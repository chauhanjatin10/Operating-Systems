Instructions - 

1) Compile the code using -> g++ Assgn1-EDF_CS17BTECH11019.cpp -o edf
					and   -> g++ Assgn1-RMS_CS17BTECH11019.cpp -o rms

2) Run the correspoding input file using -> ./edf < input.txt for EDF
											./rms < input.txt for RMS


if number of processes is greater than 1, then two files will be created ->

	1) RM-Log.txt -> this contains the details of all events. Events are considered->
		a) when a process starts execution
		b) it is preempted by another process
		c) it has encountered its deadline
		d) when it has finished its execution
		e) When it misses its deadline

	2) RM-Stats.txt -> this contains the following stats ->
		(a) number of processes that came into the system 
		(b) number of processes that successfully completed 
		(c) number of processes that missed their deadlines 
		(d) Average waiting time for each process

	Similar files will be created for EDF algorithm.
